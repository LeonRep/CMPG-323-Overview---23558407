## PROJECT BRANCHING STRARTEGY
The branching strategy that will be used throughout the semester is Github Flow and will be be implemented in four steps: create featutre branch, implement changes, merge to main and deletion of feature.
Firstly, create a feature branch from the main branch which will create safe environment to work on the main branch without affecting it. This will also allow the user to record the history of the project as it being developed.  Once the desired changes are implemented the user must merge the main and feature branch.  With the merge of the branches completed the user must delete the feature branch.  Through deleting the feature branch it shows that the work on the feature branch is completed and will prevent the user from accidentally using the old branch. 

## EXPLAIN .gitignore
Git will classify every file in the user's projects as one of three thrings: tracked, untracked and ignored. Any file that the user wants Git to ingnore must be tracked in the file named .gitignore and normally this special file is found at the root of the user's repsoitory.
