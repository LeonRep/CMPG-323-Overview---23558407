## PROJECT REPOSITORIES
The plan for the semester will be to create four additionally  Repositories containing the information of the next four Projects for the semester.  This file will contain informative information on each Project with the aim to assist users what the scope will be for each  Project as well as how they can get started.

## PROJECT BRANCHING STRARTEGY
The branching strategy that will be used throughout the semester is Github Flow and will be implemented in four steps: create feature  branch, implement changes, merge to main and deletion of feature.
Firstly, create a feature branch from the main branch which will create safe environment to work on the main branch without affecting it. This will also allow the user to record the history of the project as it being developed.  Once the desired changes are implemented the user must merge the main and feature branch.  With the merge of the branches completed the user must delete the feature branch.  Through deleting the feature branch, it shows that the work on the feature branch is completed and will prevent the user from accidentally using the old branch. 

## EXPLAIN .gitignore
Git will classify every file in the user's projects as follow: tracked, untracked and ignored. .gitignore makes provision  for files that the user wants Git to ignore and normally this special file is found at the root of the user's repository. As the semester progresses the user will continuously update this file to ensure that no unwanted files from VS Code or files containing sensitive information will be uploaded onto Github.
 
## STORAGE OF CREDENTIALS AND SENSITIVE INFORMATION
No credentials will be stored or made public on this or any other of the main user's repositories.
